# This site is a work in progress
You've stumbled onto my website (how exciting!)  
I've built this site for two reasons.
1. To create a centralized hub to manage all the services that I'm building
2. To demonstrate my web development skills to bolster my resume.  

There's a few other things you should know before you begin venturing off and find ways to break my stuff. (I'm logging everything btw)  

## Many of the modules may not yet have functionality
The fact that they exist shows that I will likely be adding content to them at some point in the near future.  

## Most of the work will be behind the scenes
Most of the things I want to build will not have any meaningful interface  
Those pieces will be visible once I standup my Architecture Diagram module  
Some modules are more for development purposes and may be removed in the future

## Things may break at any time
Who's got time for proper ci/cd? I'm the only one using this site so I don't have a need for 100% uptime.  The site itself should always exist but a module that works today may not work tomorrow if I decide I need to test something out on the actual server.  The cool news is I should theoretically be working on that section and you could expect a fix within a week!
